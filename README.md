# hello-word
this is a simple project in order to get me started in understanding github this change was made in a second branch, which is like an alternate timeline where you can make changes and experiment with a project with out risking breaking the original "Master File/ branch". so simply a branch = a copied file

if you want to save changes to the file it is called a "commit", this basically makes the new branch become the main timeline in a sense. this makes it very easy to revert back to previous versions of a project incase there was a cluster fuck up that novody noticed.
